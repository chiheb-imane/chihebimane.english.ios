<p align="center">'Family' is a single word, with many different meanings. People have many ways of defining a family and what being a part of a family means to them. Families differ in terms of economic, cultural, social, and many other facets, but what every family has in common is that the people who
 call it a family are making clear that those people are important in some way to the person calling them his family.<p>
