<h1> story time</h1>
<p align="center">
There’s no doubt that children love watching cartoons on TV and playing with them on learning apps, they transcend cultures and children easily recognize some of their favorites from their native language. This is the main reason why we encourage parents to get the advantage of the power that classic folk tales have to entertain young learners.
 Storytelling not only helps children cultivate reading comprehension skills and plants seeds for learning development,
 but it also helps learners begin to understand some essential life lessons. For example,
 empathy is a powerful lesson that children can learn through classic stories, such as The Lion and The Mouse,
 where they also teach about the importance of compassion and kindness.

Moreover, these lessons usually begin at home with family, and they are a key component in the development
 of young bilingual citizens. Aesop’s fables use animal characters to tell a story along with a moral or a lesson. 
 The stories can be complemented with cartoon or videos as visual learning aids! There are various ways to teach
 English to children through fables. Today we have some useful recommendations on teaching different types of stories
